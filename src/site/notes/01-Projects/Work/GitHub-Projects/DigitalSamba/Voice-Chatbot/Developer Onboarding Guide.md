# Developer Onboarding Guide for Digital Samba Voice Chatbot

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive guide for developers who are new to the Digital Samba Voice Chatbot repository. It's designed to help you understand the codebase and contribute effectively, even if you're not an expert in all the technologies used.

> **Important Note:** Setting up a local development environment is optional. All commits to the main branch are automatically deployed to https://voicebot-dev.digitalsamba.com/. This means you can make changes in three ways:
> 1. Directly through GitHub's web interface
> 2. By cloning the repository and using your preferred editor (recommended)
> 3. By setting up a full local development environment (for complex changes)

## Repository Overview

The Digital Samba Voice Chatbot is a voice-enabled chatbot integration for Digital Samba's WebRTC video conferencing platform. The project allows users to interact with the platform using voice commands, enhancing the accessibility and user experience of Digital Samba's video conferencing solution.

## Getting Started

### Contribution Workflows

You have three options for contributing to this project:

#### Option 1: GitHub Web Interface (Quick Changes)

1. **Browse the code** directly on GitHub
2. **Make changes** using the GitHub web editor
3. **Commit changes** to a new branch
4. **Create a pull request** to merge your changes
5. **View your changes** at https://voicebot-dev.digitalsamba.com/ once merged to main

This approach is perfect for documentation updates, simple bug fixes, or minor enhancements.

#### Option 2: Clone Repository Only (Recommended)

This option lets you edit files locally with your preferred editor without setting up the full development environment:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/digitalsamba/voice-chatbot.git
   cd voice-chatbot
   ```

2. **Create a new branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Edit files** using your favorite code editor

4. **Commit and push your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: description of your changes"
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. **Create a pull request** on GitHub

6. **View your changes** at https://voicebot-dev.digitalsamba.com/ once merged to main

This approach gives you the benefits of local editing without needing to set up the build environment.

#### Option 3: Full Local Development Environment (Complex Changes)

For complex changes that require testing or extensive development, you may want to set up a complete local environment.

### Setting Up Your Development Environment (Optional)

**Prerequisites:**
- Git
- Node.js (version X.X.X or higher)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)
- [Any other tools needed]

Follow these steps if you choose to set up a local development environment:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/digitalsamba/voice-chatbot.git
   cd voice-chatbot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Fill in the required values (contact the project manager for access keys if needed)

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Key Concepts

### Voice Recognition

The voice recognition system uses [technology name] to convert spoken language into text. This happens in `src/services/speech/recognition.js`.

### Natural Language Processing

Once the speech is converted to text, the NLP system interprets the user's intent. This is handled in `src/services/nlp/`.

### Digital Samba Integration

The integration with Digital Samba's platform is managed through their SDK. The key integration points are:
- Room joining and session management
- Audio/video stream handling
- User presence and status

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

#### Option 1: Via GitHub Web Interface

1. Navigate to the repository on GitHub
2. Browse to the file you want to edit
3. Click the pencil icon to edit the file
4. Make your changes in the editor
5. Scroll down and add a descriptive commit message
6. Select "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request"
7. Name your branch appropriately (e.g., `feature/add-voice-command`)
8. Click "Propose changes"
9. Complete the pull request form and submit

#### Option 2: Via Local Editor (Without Full Environment)

1. Make your changes in your preferred editor
2. Commit your changes with a descriptive message:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: description of your changes"
   ```
3. Push your branch to the repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
4. Create a pull request on GitHub for review

#### Option 3: Via Full Local Development

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes, following the coding standards outlined below.

3. Test your changes locally:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

4. Commit your changes with a descriptive message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: description of your changes"
   ```

5. Push your branch to the repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. Create a pull request on GitHub for review.

### Deployment

The project has an automated CI/CD pipeline set up. Any code merged into the `main` branch will automatically be deployed to the development environment at:

[https://voicebot-dev.digitalsamba.com/](https://voicebot-dev.digitalsamba.com/)

**Important Notes about Deployment:**
- Deployment happens automatically - no manual steps required
- Changes typically appear within 5-10 minutes after merging to main
- You can view the deployment status in the GitHub Actions tab
- Always check your changes on the dev site after deployment
- Deployment failures will be notified via GitHub

**Before merging to `main`, ensure:**
- All tests pass (if running locally)
- Your code has been reviewed and approved
- Your changes meet the project's quality standards

## Testing

### Option 1: Testing Without Local Setup

If you're not using a local development environment, you can still validate your changes:

1. **Create a pull request** - this will trigger automated tests in GitHub Actions
2. **Review the test results** in the pull request status
3. **Request a code review** from team members
4. **Test directly on the dev environment** after merging to main
5. **Check your changes in action** on https://voicebot-dev.digitalsamba.com/

### Option 2: Testing With Git Clone Only

If you've cloned the repository but haven't set up the full environment:

1. Review your code changes carefully in your editor
2. Use your editor's linting tools if available
3. Create a pull request to trigger automated tests
4. After merging, test on the dev environment

### Option 3: Testing Locally

If you've set up a local development environment, you can run tests locally:

```bash
npm test
```

For component testing, use:

```bash
npm run test:components
```
